In my spare time I contribute to a fledgling startup as their front end developer.

To make a consistent product you need to be on the same page, and that means sharing information. From the broad vision to the granular pieces, providing others with meaningful, applicable information is just how I do things."},

It grew out of an initial love of computers and all their capable of and my time at Pearson, working on their Learning Studio LMS. I was working on a courses that would reach hundreds of students every day. Pearson was not the place for me to build solutions that mattered to me, so when I got the opportunity to go to Galvanize and learn to make my own software from scratch, I took it. Along the way, I met up with a team of like-minded people, and we started Little Bird, a solution for a pain point our founder, Jill, had noticed for special education teachers. I still donate time in my off hours to make the tool a reality. We hope to pilot in Fall."},
        {useraccount_id: 1, type: 'snippet', text: "I also really like teaching. After my time at Galvanize as a student I became a contract instructor for a following cohort. It’s been a fulfilling role for me, and one that has come with a lot of growth. I’ve gone from having never taught before to feeling comfortable teaching all parts of the full stack program. I’ve learned how to make sure that learning outcomes come first and what to do to reach them."},
        {useraccount_id: 1, type: 'snippet', text: "Community is important to me. It’s something that I get a lot from in the form of support, meaningful dialogues, and collaboration. There are two major ways I’ve been contributing to the community around me: co-organizing the Denver Vue.js Meetup, and lending my tech skills to aspiring entrepreneurs at Startup Weekends to help them get to a working prototype working faster."},

It was amazing to see what we could glean from seeing their drill submissions, attendance  and instructor interactions."},

I’ve got a full Javascript stack under my belt, but I keep playing with new frontend Javascript frameworks, cloud datastores, server less architecture, deployment tools like Docker, and so much more. Playing with technology is my hobby."},
        {useraccount_id: 1, type: 'snippet', text: "I have experience teaching. I thought web development for six months at Galvanize, using a methodology that would fit perfectly with your product. Data driven teaching is how I learned to teach, and that perspective brings a lot to how I approach problems. I’ve also done a lot on one on one teaching and mentoring, preparing me to share knowledge with team mates effectively."},

I have the experience and resources to translate business requirements to development tasks, manage project timelines and deadlines, and adjust as needed to get things done right."},

With my background in design I can easily communicate with advertisers and internal designers, taking what they need and translating it into technical requirements. Additionally, the critical creativity that made me a good designer makes me great at innovating with code. Development is more than just making an app, it’s a way to meet needs and solve problems."},

Originally, I started an Etsy shop with a friend as a creative outlet and a way to make a little extra from my hobbies. It grew into a collective of five artists, with me in charge of the business needs. Most recently I’ve been involved with Little Bird, an educational technology startup I co-founded at a Startup Weekend event. We’ve been growing the product on the side and are going on a year now with a pilot on the horizon."},

I was assigned project and then it was up to me to make sure I got the work done on time. Where I felt the tools provided to me were inefficient I built my own and adjusted my process to work faster and more accurately."},
        {useraccount_id: 1, type: 'snippet', text: "I’m a versatile developer. I’m a Vue.js super-fan (co-organizer of the local Vue.js meet up), but I also love working with backend code. I have a background in design, but also project management. I can read technical specifications as easily as a design brief and write either after talking to a client. I can own any part of the development lifecycle that I need to. I can teach both technical and soft skills to groups or one on one."},

        {useraccount_id: 1, type: 'snippet', text: "Vue.js and Node.js are the cornerstones of my stack. I’m a huge fan of Vue.js, even co-organizing the local meet up. I’ve got a side gig helping an EdTech startup I co-founded get built up using Vue.js and Node.js and bringing in the necessary tools to get us test driven with an automated deployment pipeline. Javascript is overall my favorite language to develop in and I’m as comfortable writing vanilla Javascript to complete a task as using framework to get it done."},
        {useraccount_id: 1, type: 'snippet', text: "I’m super excited about progressive web apps. I haven’t yet had the opportunity to do more than play around with the Vue.js PWA template, but it’s something I’m excited to learn and implement. It’s much more valuable to have one app that’s device agnostic than maintaining a web app and several native apps. It’s great to see the necessary features pick up support in browsers lately."},
        {useraccount_id: 1, type: 'snippet', text: "My background in project management and design makes me a versatile resource. Startups typically need to run lean, and I fit well into teams like that with my diverse set of skills. I can take business needs and translate them to technical requirements, write user stories, make wire frames, and develop the feature. I’m comfortable with all the parts of the project lifecycle."},

There’s so much to be gained by working with others, especially on complex software projects. I have experience fostering that collaboration both as a project manager and as a development teacher. I frequently ran standup for groups of students to track their progress and guide them towards their next steps."},

A large part of my job as a project manager for Pearson was to bring in the needed team for each part of the project and communicate the project status with stakeholders, all of which were scattered around the country. Some teams were even outside the US, so managing the project so that they had time to work on it on opposite hours from our own was important."},

There’s so much power in being able to adapt to change, retro and adjust how you’re working, and work in small iterations. I primarily use Trello, and I use it to keep track of everything, even my personal to-do."},

As a project manager I found the  project management tools I’d been given lacking, so I made my own using Google Sheets. They were a lot more robust and well suited to my work.
